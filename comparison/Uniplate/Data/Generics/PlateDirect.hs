    This module supplies a method for writing 'Biplate' instances more easily.
    This module requires fewest extensions, highest performance, and most instance
    definitions.
    
    To take an example:
    
    > data Expr = Var Int | Pos Expr String | Neg Expr | Add Expr Expr
    > data Stmt = Seq [Stmt] | Sel [Expr] | Let String Expr
    >
    > instance PlateOne Expr where
    >     plateOne (Var x  ) = plate Var |- x
    >     plateOne (Pos x y) = plate Pos |* x |- y
    >     plateOne (Neg x  ) = plate Neg |* x
    >     plateOne (Add x y) = plate Add |* x |* y
    >
    > instance PlateAll Expr Expr where
    >     plateAll = plateSelf
    >
    > instance PlateOne Stmt where
    >     plateOne (Seq x  ) = plate Seq ||* x
    >     plateOne (Sel x  ) = plate Sel ||+ x
    >     plateOne (Let x y) = plate Let |-  x |- y
    >
    > instance PlateAll Stmt Stmt where
    >     plateAll = plateSelf
    >
    > instance PlateAll Stmt Expr where
    >     plateAll (Seq x  ) = plate Seq ||+ x
    >     plateAll (Sel x  ) = plate Sel ||* x
    >     plateAll (Let x y) = plate Let |-  x |* y
