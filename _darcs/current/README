This repository collects generics libraries for Haskell.  It is part of an
effort to develop a standard generics library that is suitably stable and 
mature to be used in application code.

The various libraries (or variants of one library) occupy one subdirectory
per library.  In some cases there is an additional LIBNAME.examples directory 
that includes further example code using the library LIBNAME.
